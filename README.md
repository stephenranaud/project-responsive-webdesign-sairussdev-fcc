# Project for section Responsive Webdesign for `My Summary FreecodeCamp`

User interface integration is a job in itself but it's also a prerequisite to be a front-end developer or engineer I'm integrating this model for my project [here](https://my-fcc-summary-sairussdev.netlify.app).

This project is built with parcel.
